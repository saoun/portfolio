  <div class="col-1-2 intro2">
    <p>These days, I dabble in full-stack web development and data visualization.
    I've worked in human rights law and policy, data storytelling,
    digital strategy. My interests lie at the intersection of code, data,
    feminism, gender, identity, and human rights. <br>
    You can find me somewhere between Brooklyn and Beirut.<br>
    Take a look at my <a href="/projects">recent projects</a>, or check out <a href="/cv">my CV</a> to get a better
    sense of what I do.<br>
